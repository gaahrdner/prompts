Task: 
- Divide the provided text into semantically coherent chunks, each containing between 250-350 words.
- Aim to preserve logical and thematic continuity within each chunk, ensuring that sentences or ideas that belong together are not split across different chunks.

Guidelines:
1. Identify natural text breaks such as paragraph ends or section divides to initiate new chunks.
2. Estimate the word count as you include content in a chunk. Begin a new chunk when you reach approximately 250 words, preferring to end on a natural break close to this count, without exceeding 350 words.
3. In cases where text does not neatly fit within these constraints, prioritize maintaining the integrity of ideas and sentences over strict adherence to word limits.
4. Adjust the boundaries iteratively, refining your initial segmentation based on semantic coherence and word count guidelines.

Your primary goal is to minimize disruption to the logical flow of content across chunks, even if slight deviations from the word count range are necessary to achieve this.
